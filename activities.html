						<h3>annual general meeting</h3>
						<p>JASNA’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) is a literary conference, a celebration of Jane Austen, and a collegial gathering of JASNA members.</p>
						<p>Each autumn 700 to 800 JASNA members attend the AGM, a three-day conference hosted by one of our regions in the United States or Canada. The AGMs feature dozens of lectures by Austen scholars and JASNA members, as well as special exhibits and events, workshops, and a banquet and Regency ball. Many papers presented at AGMs are also published in the Society’s journals Persuasions and Persuasions On-Line.</p>
						<p>Information about an upcoming conference is posted on the AGM's website and updated periodically as details are finalized. In late spring, JASNA members are invited to register for the upcoming event.</p>

								<h6>Jane Austen in the Arts</h6>
								<p>Join us in the exciting city of Chicago as we explore the strong connection between Jane Austen and the arts. Austen attended private musical evenings, enjoyed visits to the theater and galleries, and participated in family theatricals. Each of her novels features the arts in some form—from the domestic female accomplishments of playing an instrument, singing, and drawing in Emma and Pride and Prejudice, to the elaborate but private preparations for a performance of Lover’s Vows in Mansfield Park, to the public concert at the Assembly Rooms in Persuasion. In 2021 we will examine how the visual and performing arts influenced Austen’s writing and how her work has in turn inspired film, stage, and other artistic adaptations for more than 200 years.</p>

								<p>The JASNA Victoria Region is excited to invite members to the west coast of Canada to celebrate Jane Austen’s first published novel, Sense and Sensibility, from September 30 to October 2, 2022. Join us as we explore Sense and Sensibility’s nuanced treatment of love, wealth, family, marriage, duty, honor... and dueling. We have exciting plans for speakers and special activities—all full of good sense and pleasing to the sensibilities. As we create a program that highlights our city’s uniqueness, we leave you to “that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness itself.”</p>

							<h6>"Nobody Could Catch Cold by the Sea": Austen's Unfinished Chapters</h6>
							<p>Jane Austen famously produced two unfinished novels: The Watsons and Sanditon. Both have been been adapted recently for television and the theater and are now inspirations for the 2020 JASNA-sponsored tour. The itinerary includes locations important in Jane Austen’s life, sites used in the recent TV adaptation of Sanditon, and a performance of the play The Watsons.</p>
							<p>Join JASNA members on a tour of the towns and countryside most associated with Jane Austen: Steventon, Chawton, Bath, Winchester, Oxford, and London. While in Hampshire, visit Jane Austen’s House Museum, Chawton House, St. Nicholas Church in Steventon, and St. Nicholas Church in Chawton. Go to the Annual General Meeting of the Jane Austen Society (UK) in Chawton and attend a special program at the Hampshire Cultural Trust to hear Austen expert Louise West talk about costumes, accessories, and textiles in Jane Austen’s time.</p>
							<p>Spend a full day in Lyme Regis, where you can walk on the Cobb, see the lodgings of the Austen family , and spend time at the Philpott Museum learning about Mary Anning, the fossil hunter. In Bath, visit the sites associated with Jane Austen and her family and take an excursion to Dyrham Park, used in the re-creation of Sanditon. In Oxford, view the manuscript of The Watsons and visit St John’s College, where Jane Austen’s father and two brothers studied. In London, see some of Austen's manuscripts and her writing desk at the British Library and attend a West End production of the The Watsons.</p>

							<h6>"Emma" by Jane Austen</h6>
							<p>Beautiful, clever, rich—and single—Emma Woodhouse is perfectly content with her life and sees no need for either love or marriage. Nothing, however, delights her more than interfering in the romantic lives of others. But when she ignores the warnings of her good friend Mr. Knightley and attempts to arrange a suitable match for her protegee Harriet Smith, her carefully laid plans soon unravel and have consequences that she never expected.</p>

							<p>The police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and others and the pandemic that has disproportionately killed along racial lines have shocked the world into a confrontation of inequities. It’s time for the community of those involved in the scholarship and discussion of Jane Austen and her world to examine the limited ways in which we understand Jane Austen’s writing and the world of which she was a part and the limited ways we write and talk about those subjects.</p>

						<h3>international visitor program</h3>
						<p>JASNA's International Visitor Program (IVP) provides a member the opportunity to work on a creative or scholarly project in Jane Austen’s village of Chawton, England, for up to six weeks in July and August.</p>
						<h4>International Visitor Support</h4>
						<p>JASNA provides the International Visitor a fellowship of $3,250 (US dollars), which is to be used to defray the costs for round-trip airfare to England from the continental United States or Canada, housing, and miscellaneous travel and research expenses.</p>
						<h4>Austen Project</h4>
						<p>The International Visitor Program requires a full-time commitment from the recipient for the duration of the visit. While much of the time in England will be spent working on a self-defined Austen project, the International Visitor will also work two days a week at Austen-related institutions in Chawton performing duties as assigned. The visitor will also attend the U.K. Jane Austen Society’s Annual General Meeting in July and provide assistance as requested by the Society.</p>
						<h4>Applications will be evaluated according to the following criteria:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>The importance of the project</li>
							<li>The applicant’s need for access to materials in Chawton or nearby</li>
							<li>The viability of the project (in terms of project parameters, time, and resources)</li>
							<li>The useful skills that the applicant brings to JASNA’s Austen-related partners in Chawton</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Eligibility</h4>
						<p>IVP candidates must be members of JASNA who live in the United States or Canada and have an Austen-related project that requires access to resources in England. It is not necessary to be a student or a career academic.</p>
						<p class="programs-bold-para">The 2020 International Visitor has been selected, but the visit to Chawton has been postponed to 2021 due to the global pandemic. Please check back in fall 2021 for details about the 2022 program and to download the 2022 application and fact sheet.</p>
